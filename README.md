# Multiple Object Recognition using tensorflow API 

Object detection is a technology in the field of computer vision for finding and identifying objects in an image or video sequence. 

In this project we will be detecting multiple objects in an image using the Tensorflow object detection API. 

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the PASCAL-VOC 2012. Pascal VOC is a collection of datasets for object detection. The main goal is to recognize objects from a number of visual object classes in realistic scenes. The twenty object classes that are existing are:

- Person: person
- Animal: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep
- Vehicle: aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train
- Indoor: bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor
